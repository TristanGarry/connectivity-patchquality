# connectivity-patchquality
SESIM experiment

All code required to replicate my EEB397 project: Identifying the combined effects of patch quality and connectivity on metacommunity dynamics.
Project supervised by Carina Firkowski and Marie-Jos√©e Fortin

Questions and comments can be directed to tristan.garry@mail.utoronto.ca

Please note that this repository is outdated as of November 19, 2019 due to further developments past my EEB397 and so could be taken down when I am ready to publish more relevant and robust code
